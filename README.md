# Lotto

This repository contains a set of three C programs designed to generate lottery numbers. They use the standard library's random number generator and sorting function to accomplish this.

The programs accepts an optional command-line argument, which specifies how many sets of lottery numbers to generate. If an argument is not provided, the program prompts the user to enter the number of combinations required.

The lotto program was originally written in 1992 and later forked to include Powerball and MegaMillions.

Windows 10 executables are included in the repository.
